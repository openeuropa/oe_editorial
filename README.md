# OpenEuropa Editorial

This module provides editorial features for the OpenEuropa project.

## Drupal 10 support.

Support for Drupal 10 will be added only in 2.x releases.

## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

In 2.x, the support to Poetry has been dropped. In order to upgrade from 1.x to 2.x:

- uninstall `oe_editorial_corporate_workflow_translation_poetry`;
- upgrade to a 2.x release.

## Development setup

You can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running,
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the behat tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```

#### Step debugging

To enable step debugging from the command line, pass the `XDEBUG_SESSION` environment variable with any value to
the container:

```bash
docker-compose exec -e XDEBUG_SESSION=1 web <your command>
```

Please note that, starting from XDebug 3, a connection error message will be outputted in the console if the variable is
set but your client is not listening for debugging connections. The error message will cause false negatives for PHPUnit
tests.

To initiate step debugging from the browser, set the correct cookie using a browser extension or a bookmarklet
like the ones generated at https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/.
